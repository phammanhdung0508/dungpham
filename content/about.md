![Me](../static/me_small.jpg)

Hi there! I'm **Dung Pham**, currently live in **District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam**.

I recently graduated from **FPT University** in Ho Chi Minh City with a degree in **Software Engineering**. During my time at university, I interned at **FPT Software** for four months.

My passion lies in developing back-end applications and delving into product development. It's been a fulfilling journey over the years.

**I decided to start this blog as a way to challenge myself, document my understanding, and enhance my knowledge along the way.**
